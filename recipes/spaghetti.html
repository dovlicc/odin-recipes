    <h1> Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>
    <img src="../img/spaghetti.jpg" width="200" alt="tasty spaghetti">

    <p>Spaghetti, a classic comfort dish, is like the pasta equivalent of a warm, reassuring hug. It starts with al dente pasta, perfectly cooked to retain a satisfying bite. The hero of the dish is the tomato sauceâ€”simmered to perfection with garlic, onions, herbs, and perhaps a touch of red pepper flakes for a subtle kick. You can add juicy meatballs, savory Italian sausage, or go for a vegetarian twist with roasted vegetables. The final flourish is a generous shower of grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese. Each twirl of the fork brings together the flavors into a harmonious medley, making every bite a journey through a landscape of rich, savory goodness. Spaghetti is not just a meal; it's a timeless, comforting experience that transcends the boundaries of a plate.
